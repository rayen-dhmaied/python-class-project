# Python class project
Python application consists of CLI Interface, GUI Interface (Tkinter) and small logical games. I did the project during my CS bachelor's 1st year and I got best grade in class. 😁

# How to run
Please install `colorama` and `Tkinter` to run the application using the following commands:
```
pip install colorama
pip install tk
```
Double click on `menu_gui.pyw` to run the GUI Interface and `menu_cli.py` to run CLI Interface.
